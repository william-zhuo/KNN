# KNN
Overview

This project implements an interactive k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier that allows users to visualize how the algorithm works. Users can add data points, adjust parameters like the number of neighbors (k), and see real-time predictions.

Features

Interactive Data Input: Users can add points to the dataset dynamically.

Adjustable Parameters: Change the value of k to see how it affects classification.

Real-time Predictions: Predictions update automatically based on user input.

Visualization: A graphical representation of the dataset and classification boundaries.

Technologies Used:

- Python

- PyGame


Usage

Run the application:

python app.py

Example

If a dataset consists of red and blue points, adding a new point will classify it based on the k nearest neighbors.



Future Improvements

Add support for different distance metrics.

Implement additional machine learning models for comparison.

Enhance UI with interactive drag-and-drop features.
